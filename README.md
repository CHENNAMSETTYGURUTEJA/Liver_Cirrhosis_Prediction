# Liver_Cirrhosis_Prediction

This project is a Flask web application that predicts whether a patient is likely to have liver disease based on medical and lifestyle input features.
It uses a Machine Learning model (liver_prediction.pkl) trained with patient data and integrates it into a simple web interface.

## 🚀 Features

>User-friendly web form to enter patient details (age, gender, blood test results, lifestyle habits, etc.)

>Predicts "Diabetes" or "Non-Diabetes" based on model output (labels can be adjusted based on dataset)

>Built with Flask and Scikit-learn

>Easily deployable on local system or cloud platforms (Heroku, Render, etc.)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1)Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/CHENNAMSETTYGURUTEJA/Liver_Cirrhosis_Prediction.git

cd Liver_Cirrhosis_Prediction

### 2)Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
